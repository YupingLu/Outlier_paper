\section{Conclusions}
In this paper we tested pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient, univariate SSA and multivariate K-means and combined them as a framework to detect outliers in the ARM data. Each method has its own drawbacks. But our experiments showed that this framework worked well compared to the manually Data Quality Report method. Currently, we only tested MET data from SGP. And we analyzed data from each instrument independently. We will apply this framework on other types of data from other facilities in the future. Meanwhile, other methods will be examined to test data from multiple instruments together such as graph theory methods \cite{phillips2015graph} and machine learning methods.
